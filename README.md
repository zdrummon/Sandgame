# Sandgame
Making a basic falling sand simulator and seeing if I can do some fun stuff with that, inspired by Noita

1. install docker and vscode (possibly also need wsl, return to this step if necessary)
2. download image (in cmd: "docker pull accetto/ubuntu-vnc-xfce-opengl-g3")
3. ctrl + shift + p in vscode: "open container" (I think, may be wrong name)
4. in terminal: "sudo apt install -y git" (pass: headless)
5. in terminal: "mkdir dev"
6. in terminal: "cd dev"
7. in terminal: "git config --global user.name first_name last_name"
8. in terminal: "git config --global user.email your_email@email_host.com"
